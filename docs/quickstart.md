# Getting Started

Get up and running in under 15 minutes.

## For builders

1. Sign up at [app.devplan.com](https://app.devplan.com) using Google SSO or magic link. The 14-day free trial includes everything.
2. Connect GitHub under **Knowledge > Code Research** — first-time analysis takes around 30 minutes.
3. Hit **New Project**, give the agent a description, and let it generate your product brief and user stories.
4. Move to the **Development** tab, sync to Linear or Jira, and grab the CLI command from any task to start building.

## For teams

1. Go to **Settings > Organization**, create an org, and choose a plan — **Builder** at $24/user/month or **Team** at $49/user/month.
2. Invite team members under **Settings > Team** and assign roles.
3. Add product and technical docs under **Knowledge > Company** to give agents shared context.
4. Connect GitHub under **Knowledge > Code Research** — first-time analysis takes around 30 minutes.
5. Connect Linear or Jira under **Settings > Integrations**.
6. Create your first project — attach docs, images, or tickets and kick off the agent.
7. A shared Slack channel is available on supported plans for onboarding support.
