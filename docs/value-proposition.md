# Why Devplan? The Value Proposition

## The Problem: AI Isn't Delivering on Its Promise

Despite the excitement around AI in software development, teams are experiencing a significant gap between expectations and reality:

### Current AI Development Challenges

**📊 The Numbers Don't Lie:**
- AI-generated code requires **30-50% rework** in real-world applications
- Senior developers are actually **19% slower** when using AI coding tools (MIT study)
- Overall productivity gains are only **10%** for codebases over 100k lines of code (Stanford study)
- Most AI pilots in enterprise environments are failing

**🔍 Root Causes:**
- **Missing Context**: AI tools lack understanding of your specific codebase, product decisions, and company standards
- **Disconnected Workflows**: Planning happens in isolation from the technical implementation
- **Generic Output**: AI generates vague, non-specific requirements and code that doesn't fit your product
- **No Shared Understanding**: Teams waste time arguing in Slack about unclear specifications

## The Solution: Context-Driven AI Development

Devplan transforms AI from a generic code generator into an intelligent teammate that understands your product, codebase, and team context.

### How Devplan Delivers Real AI Value

    I --> J[Production-Ready Code]
```

**🎯 The Devplan Difference:**
1. **Deep Context Understanding**: We analyze your GitHub repos, product docs, team discussions, and user feedback
2. **Connected Workflows**: From idea to code, every step maintains context and intent
3. **AI-Native Experience**: Purpose-built for AI-assisted development, not retrofitted tools
4. **Production Quality**: Generate code that fits your patterns, follows your standards, and requires minimal rework

## Proven Results

### Performance Improvements
- **8x faster** project planning time
- **25% improvement** in AI coding quality
- **80 minutes saved** per feature in planning alone
- **Reduced rework** from better context and specifications

### Real Customer Impact

> "We are running our 15-person VC-backed company right now without a PM. Devplan helps fill that gap for us by generating high-quality user stories that sync in Linear in minutes. What used to take me days of back and forth and refinement I'm now doing in less than an hour."
