# Why Devplan? The Value Proposition

*5 min read • Understanding the problem Devplan solves and the proven results*

## The AI Development Gap

Despite massive AI adoption in software development, teams aren't seeing the productivity gains they expected. The problem isn't the AI—it's the missing context.

### The Reality of AI Development Today

:::warning Current State
**The Numbers:**
- **30-50% rework** required for AI-generated code in production
- **19% slower** senior developers when using generic AI tools (MIT study)
- **Only 10% productivity gains** for large codebases (Stanford study)
- **Most enterprise AI pilots are failing**
:::

### Why AI Tools Fall Short

**🔍 Missing Context**
Generic AI tools don't understand your specific codebase, architectural decisions, or business requirements.

**⚙️ Disconnected Workflows**
Planning happens in isolation from implementation, causing miscommunication and rework.

**📝 Generic Output**
AI generates code and requirements that don't fit your actual product or team standards.

**💬 Communication Gaps**
Teams waste hours clarifying vague specifications and conflicting assumptions.

## The Devplan Solution

Devplan bridges the context gap by connecting your entire development ecosystem—from product planning to code implementation.

### Context-Driven AI Development

```

**🎯 What Makes Us Different:**

1. **Deep Context Understanding** - Analyze your repos, docs, and team patterns
2. **Connected Intelligence** - Maintain context from idea to deployed code
3. **AI-Native Workflow** - Built for AI development, not retrofitted
4. **Production Quality** - Generate code that fits your patterns and standards
