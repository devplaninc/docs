:::tip Choose Your Path
🚀 **Fast Track (5 min):** Account + GitHub + CLI → Start building immediately

🏢 **Complete Setup (15 min):** All integrations + team setup + first project
:::

## Step 1: Account Setup

**Time: 2 minutes**

### Create Your Account

1. **Sign Up** at [devplan.com](https://devplan.com)
   - Google SSO for fastest setup
   - Or magic-link login with email

2. **Choose Plan** (can change later):
   ```

   ✅ Perfect for: Small teams, agencies, startups

   📈 Professional: $49/user + AI credits
   ✅ Perfect for: Growing product teams, scale-ups
   ```

3. **Quick Profile Setup**:
   - Company name and role
   - Primary tech stack (we'll analyze your repos for details)
   - Team size estimate

:::note Free Trial
**14-day free trial** includes:
- 2 repository analyses
- Unlimited projects and features
- Full CLI access
- Access to a subset generated prompts for testing. 
:::

## Step 2: GitHub Integration (Optional, but high recommended)

**Time: 3 minutes**

### Connect Your Repository

**Why this matters:** Devplan analyzes your codebase to understand patterns, architecture, and conventions. 
This enables AI to generate code that actually fits your project.

```bash
1. Settings → Integrations → GitHub
2. "Connect GitHub Account" → Authorize Devplan
3. Select repositories to analyze (start with 1-2 main repos)
4. Click "Start Analysis"
```

**Analysis Progress:**
```
⌛ Analyzing repository structure...
⌛ Detecting frameworks and patterns...
⌛ Understanding component architecture...
✓ Analysis complete! (2-5 minutes for most repos)
```

:::tip Repository Analysis
**What's Analyzed:**
- ✅ Framework and tech stack detection
- ✅ Component patterns and conventions
- ✅ Database schemas and API structures
- ✅ Testing and build configurations

**What's NOT Stored:**
- ❌ Your actual source code
- ❌ Sensitive data or credentials
- ❌ Business logic details
:::

## Step 3: Project Management Integration (Optional)

**Time: 2 minutes each • Can skip and do later**

### Quick Setup Options

**Linear (Recommended):**
1. Connect Linear in `Settings → Integrations → Linear`

**Jira:**
1. Install [Devplan Jira Atlassian](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/install/cd539bc3-11b5-4b71-a82d-d8af831435a1?signature=AYABeETqleNeikM5CMnAxz%2B755IAAAADAAdhd3Mta21zAEthcm46YXdzOmttczp1cy1lYXN0LTE6NzA5NTg3ODM1MjQzOmtleS83ZjcxNzcxZC02OWM4LTRlOWItYWU5Ny05MzJkMmNhZjM0NDIAuAECAQB4KVgoNesMySI2pXEz4J5S%2B4but%2FgpPvEEG0vL8V0Jz5cBPXqIpFHwuylgGhQUrD7WFAAAAH4wfAYJKoZIhvcNAQcGoG8wbQIBADBoBgkqhkiG9w0BBwEwHgYJYIZIAWUDBAEuMBEEDJcRfkjl7WpHMarLtAIBEIA7mc2prFXlHJjTKbDnNcpmzeACyi2tBtMq3hVrGHdh2akO5mTfwz%2BBy6EHr6bPeNKoM2L60HHHIemHrDIAB2F3cy1rbXMAS2Fybjphd3M6a21zOmV1LXdlc3QtMTo3MDk1ODc4MzUyNDM6a2V5LzU1OWQ0NTE2LWE3OTEtNDdkZi1iYmVkLTAyNjFlODY4ZWE1YwC4AQICAHig7hOcRWe1S%2BcRRsjD9q0WpZcapmXa1oPX3jm4ao883gF4Eo5GpaFrAlXkpsEWdYNKAAAAfjB8BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagbzBtAgEAMGgGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMn%2FqaVxEv1dTfPdUbAgEQgDuBVtVlNMJJ47vMCa7oWNLyN%2BfRjcnRrVN%2BiX%2BjGQnibmcqInsNVcfBzPugUtVZ6PNUkDRe%2Bsgm7urUPgAHYXdzLWttcwBLYXJuOmF3czprbXM6dXMtd2VzdC0yOjcwOTU4NzgzNTI0MzprZXkvM2M0YjQzMzctYTQzOS00ZmNhLWEwZDItNDcyYzE2ZWRhZmRjALgBAgIAeBeusbAYURagY7RdQhCHwxFswh7l65V7cwKp%2BDc1WGoHAVlLDoEvXPFCxzm%2FW5nVIsQAAAB%2BMHwGCSqGSIb3DQEHBqBvMG0CAQAwaAYJKoZIhvcNAQcBMB4GCWCGSAFlAwQBLjARBAwoTaqw7IFZWPAYzAYCARCAO3gE%2FMvECQjfUjr0lqu2N5T%2FdiuIAKtBgtXKQypXXfHqYzmqbMPGvL5WjVe8MxHYmGyUnpK0jog1ssaRAgAAAAAMAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOYf7d4xRr3RzSZt2Jc8A%2Fr%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAADJtmNORi7b8ozuX4AmbPzgLt1wtlQC7ySPPBb8KDvfFhFGzE9BK0iAxszz6eCbUaX2oBe%2FkWOBdho%2BVmvPIwCsBVUY%3D&product=jira) application.
2. Connect or re-connect Jira from the `Settings -> Integrations` screen

:::note Why Integrate?
**Project management sync enables:**
- ✅ Automatic ticket creation from user stories
- ✅ Real-time status updates
- ✅ Context links between tickets and requirements
- ✅ Sprint planning with Devplan estimates
:::

## Step 3: CLI Installation (Optional, recommended for working with codign prompts)

**Time: 2 minutes • Brings Devplan context directly into your IDE**

### Install the CLI

**Option 1: Homebrew (Recommended)**
```bash
# Manual updates required
brew tap devplaninc/devplan && brew install devplan
```

**Option 2: Direct Install**
```bash
# One-command install with auto-updates
curl -fsSL https://app.devplan.com/cli/install | bash
```

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Authenticate
devplan auth

# 2. Verify installation
devplan version
```

## Step 4: Your First Project

**Time: 10-20 minutes to create for the full cycle**

### Create a Project

**Quick Start:**
```
1. Devplan → "New Project"
2. Enter project details.
3. Work through the flow.
```

### Try Your First Feature

**Let's build a simple feature together:**

**Input:** "Add a contact form to our landing page"

**What happens next:**

:::note AI Discovery Session
**Devplan Agent:** "I see this is a Next.js project with Tailwind CSS. For the contact form:

1. Should this send emails directly, or save to a database?
2. What fields do you need? (Name, email, message, company?)
3. I notice you're using Shadcn components. Should the form match that style?
4. Do you need any validation or spam protection?
5. Where should users go after submitting?"

**You:** "Send emails via our existing email service, include name/email/message, yes use Shadcn, add basic validation, show a success message."

**Agent:** "Perfect! I'll create a feature spec with those requirements."
:::

### Review Your Generated Plan

**PRD Generated (2 minutes):**
✅ Feature overview and business requirements
✅ Technical implementation using your existing patterns
✅ User stories with acceptance criteria
✅ Time estimates based on your codebase complexity

**Sample User Stories:**
```markdown
Story 1: Contact Form Component (3 hours)
- Form with name, email, message fields
- Shadcn Input and Button components
- Zod validation schema
- Loading and error states

Story 2: Email Service Integration (2 hours)
- Server action for form submission
- Integration with existing email service
- Success/error response handling

Total Estimate: 5 hours
```

### Start Development

**Use the CLI to get context:**
1. Open "Coding Prompts" tab.
2. Click `Clone` or `Focus` buttons which will copy corresponding CLI commands to your clipboard.
3. Run the commands in your terminal.
4. Ask AI IDE to implement current feature.

**Your AI assistant now knows:**
- ✓ Your Next.js project structure
- ✓ Shadcn component patterns you use
- ✓ Existing form validation approaches
- ✓ Email service integration details
- ✓ Specific files to create/modify

:::tip First Feature Success
**Typical first feature results:**
- ✅ Implementation matches your existing code style
- ✅ AI suggestions are relevant to your project
- ✅ Less back-and-forth clarification needed
- ✅ Code reviews focus on business logic, not style
