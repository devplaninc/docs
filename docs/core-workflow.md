## Step 1: Input and Context Processing

### Starting Points
Devplan accepts various input formats to begin the planning process:

**üìù Text Inputs:**
- Quick feature ideas or requests
- Customer feedback and bug reports
- Existing specifications or documentation
- User stories or epics from other tools

**üé® Visual Inputs:**
- UX mockups and design files
- User flow diagrams
- Architecture sketches

**üìä Data Inputs:**
- Analytics insights
- Customer interview notes
- Market research findings

### Context Engine Processing

Behind the scenes, Devplan's Context Engine analyzes:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Your Input] --> B[Context Engine]

    C[GitHub Repos] --> B
    D[Company Docs] --> B
    E[Previous Projects] --> B
    F[Team Standards] --> B
    G[User Feedback] --> B
    H[Product Analytics] --> B

    B --> I[Enriched Understanding]
```

**What Gets Analyzed:**
- **Codebase Architecture**: Existing patterns, frameworks, and technical decisions
- **Product Context**: Current features, user flows, and business logic
- **Team Standards**: Coding conventions, review processes, and documentation styles
- **Historical Decisions**: Past project learnings and architectural choices

## Step 2: Agent-Guided Discovery

### Intelligent Questioning
Devplan's Planning Agent doesn't just accept your input‚Äîit actively helps you think through the requirements by asking targeted questions based on your codebase analysis and project context.

:::tip What Makes This Different
**Context-Aware Questions:** Unlike generic planning tools, Devplan knows your tech stack, existing patterns, and architectural decisions, so it asks relevant questions that matter for your specific implementation.
:::

### Real Discovery Session Example

**Initial Input:** "Add user authentication to our SaaS dashboard"

**Agent Discovery Process:**

**üîç Context Analysis (Automatic)**
```
Analyzing codebase...
‚úì Detected: Next.js 14 with App Router
‚úì Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma
‚úì Existing: Basic user model in schema
‚úì UI Library: Tailwind + Shadcn components
```

**ü§ñ Agent Questions:**
1. "I see you have a basic User model. Do you want email/password auth, OAuth (Google/GitHub), or both?"
2. "Your app uses Prisma. Should we extend the existing User schema or create separate auth tables?"
3. "I notice you're using Shadcn components. Should the login form match your existing Button and Input patterns?"
4. "Do you need password reset functionality, and should it integrate with your existing email system?"
5. "Should authenticated routes redirect to a specific dashboard page, or stay on the current page?"

**üìù Collaborative Refinement:**
- PM clarifies business requirements
- Agent suggests technical approaches based on existing code
- Team discusses integration points and edge cases
- Final requirements capture both business and technical needs

:::note Why This Works
This collaborative process typically uncovers 3-5 critical requirements that would otherwise be discovered during implementation, preventing costly rework.
:::

## Step 3: PRD Generation

### Intelligent Document Creation
Based on the discovery session, Devplan generates a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) that includes:

**üìã Standard PRD Sections:**
- Executive summary and goals
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Technical requirements and constraints

**üîç Context-Enhanced Content:**
- Integration points with existing systems
- Code architecture recommendations
- Specific implementation considerations
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### AI Review Process
Devplan's Review Agent acts as your personal Chief Product Officer, analyzing the generated PRD for:

- **Completeness**: Are all aspects of the feature covered?
- **Clarity**: Can engineers implement this without additional clarification?
- **Feasibility**: Are the requirements technically achievable?
- **Alignment**: Does this fit with existing product strategy and architecture?

## Step 4: Technical Design & Architecture

### Code-Aware Planning
Unlike generic planning tools, Devplan understands your technical stack and generates implementation guidance that considers:

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Integration:**
- How new code fits into existing modules
- Database schema changes required
- API endpoints that need modification
- Dependencies and service interactions

**‚öôÔ∏è Technical Specifications:**
- Component structure and hierarchy
- State management requirements
- Testing strategy and coverage
- Performance considerations

### Example Technical Breakdown

For the dark mode feature:
```
Components to Modify:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ThemeProvider.tsx (extend theme context)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SettingsPage.tsx (add toggle component)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Header.tsx (apply theme classes)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sidebar.tsx (apply theme classes)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 12 additional UI components

New Utilities Needed:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useTheme() hook
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ThemeToggle component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ localStorage persistence layer

Database Changes:
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user_preferences.theme_mode (varchar)
```

## Step 5: User Stories & Task Breakdown

**I want** to protect authenticated routes
**So that** only logged-in users can access the dashboard

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Middleware checks authentication status
- Unauthenticated users redirect to login
- Authenticated users can access protected pages
- Login page redirects authenticated users to dashboard

**Estimate:** 3 hours | AI Complexity: Low
```
:::

**Total Feature Estimate:** 13 hours across 3 stories
**Recommended Sprint Allocation:** 1-2 sprints depending on team capacity

**üéØ Specific Implementation Guidance:**
- Exact file paths and component names
- Integration points with existing code
- Code patterns and conventions to follow
- Error handling and edge case considerations

### Real AI Coding Prompt Example

**Generated for: User Authentication Feature**

````markdown
## Implement User Registration and Login Components

**Context:** Adding authentication to Next.js 14 SaaS dashboard with existing Prisma setup and Shadcn UI components.

**Files to Create/Modify:**
```
src/app/(auth)/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ login/page.tsx          # Login page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ register/page.tsx       # Registration page
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx             # Auth layout

src/components/auth/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LoginForm.tsx          # Main login form
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RegisterForm.tsx       # Registration form
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AuthButton.tsx         # Reusable auth button

src/lib/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.ts               # Auth utilities
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
1. **Form Components**: Use existing form patterns from `src/components/ui/form.tsx` and `src/lib/validations.ts`
2. **Database Integration**: Extend existing User model in `prisma/schema.prisma` with auth fields
3. **UI Consistency**: Follow button patterns from `src/components/ui/button.tsx` and input styling from `src/components/ui/input.tsx`
4. **Error Handling**: Use existing toast system from `src/components/ui/use-toast.ts`

**Code Patterns to Follow:**
```typescript
// Follow existing form validation pattern
import { z } from "zod"
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod"

// Use established server action pattern
import { createUser } from "@/lib/actions/user"

// Follow existing error handling
import { toast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast"
```

**Integration Points:**
- Integrate with existing middleware pattern in `middleware.ts`
- Use current database connection from `lib/db.ts`
- Follow existing API route structure in `app/api/`
- Maintain accessibility standards with proper ARIA labels

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests following patterns in `__tests__/components/`
- Integration tests for auth flow
- Form validation edge cases

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Users can register with email/password
- [ ] Login form validates and authenticates users
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Forms are accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] UI matches existing design system

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### üîß Context and AI Issues

**Problem:** AI prompts seem generic or miss important context
```bash
# Check repository analysis status
devplan repo status

# Re-analyze if needed
devplan repo refresh

# Verify integration
devplan auth status
```

**Problem:** Estimates don't match team velocity
```markdown
# In your completed tickets, add feedback:
"Actual time: 8 hours (estimated 4 hours)
Reason: Needed to refactor existing auth service"

# System learns from this feedback for future estimates
```

### üîó Integration Issues

**Linear/Jira Sync Problems:**

**Check Integration Status:**
```bash
# Verify connection
devplan integrations list

# Test sync
devplan sync --dry-run

# Full resync if needed
devplan sync --force
```

**Common Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Verify API permissions in Linear/Jira
- ‚úÖ Check webhook URLs are accessible
- ‚úÖ Ensure project mapping is correct
- ‚úÖ Validate user permissions for ticket creation

### üíª CLI and Development Issues

**CLI Not Working:**
```bash
# Check authentication
devplan auth status

# Re-authenticate if needed
devplan logout && devplan login

# Verify project linking
devplan project info

# Check you're in correct directory
pwd  # Should be in your project root
```

**IDE Context Not Loading:**
```bash
# Verify context files were created
ls .devplan/

# Regenerate if missing
devplan focus --force

# Check IDE-specific files
ls .cursorrules  # For Cursor
ls .claude/     # For Claude Code
```
