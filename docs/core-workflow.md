## Step 1: Input and Context Processing

### Starting Points
Devplan accepts various input formats to begin the planning process:

**üìù Text Inputs:**
- Quick feature ideas or requests
- Customer feedback and bug reports
- Existing specifications or documentation
- User stories or epics from other tools

**üé® Visual Inputs:**
- UX mockups and design files
- User flow diagrams
- Architecture sketches

**üìä Data Inputs:**
- Analytics insights
- Customer interview notes
- Market research findings

### Context Engine Processing

Behind the scenes, Devplan's Context Engine analyzes:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Your Input] --> B[Context Engine]

    C[GitHub Repos] --> B
    D[Company Docs] --> B
    E[Previous Projects] --> B
    F[Team Standards] --> B
    G[User Feedback] --> B
    H[Product Analytics] --> B

    B --> I[Enriched Understanding]
```

**What Gets Analyzed:**
- **Codebase Architecture**: Existing patterns, frameworks, and technical decisions
- **Product Context**: Current features, user flows, and business logic
- **Team Standards**: Coding conventions, review processes, and documentation styles
- **Historical Decisions**: Past project learnings and architectural choices

## Step 2: Agent-Guided Discovery

### Intelligent Questioning
Devplan's Planning Agent doesn't just accept your input‚Äîit actively helps you think through the requirements by asking targeted questions based on your codebase analysis and project context.

<img src={prdQuestions} alt="Example banner" style={{width: '600px'}}/>

:::tip What Makes This Different
**Context-Aware Questions:** Unlike generic planning tools, Devplan knows your tech stack, existing patterns, and architectural decisions, so it asks relevant questions that matter for your specific implementation.
:::

:::note Why This Works
This collaborative process typically uncovers 3-5 critical requirements that would otherwise be discovered during implementation, preventing costly rework.
:::

## Step 3: PRD Generation

### Intelligent Document Creation
Based on the discovery session, Devplan generates a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) that includes:

**üìã Standard PRD Sections:**
- Executive summary and goals
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Technical requirements and constraints

**üîç Context-Enhanced Content:**
- Integration points with existing systems
- Code architecture recommendations
- Specific implementation considerations
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### AI Review Process
Devplan's Review Agent acts as your personal Chief Product Officer, analyzing the generated PRD for:

- **Completeness**: Are all aspects of the feature covered?
- **Clarity**: Can engineers implement this without additional clarification?
- **Feasibility**: Are the requirements technically achievable?
- **Alignment**: Does this fit with existing product strategy and architecture?

<img src={prdSelfReview} alt="Example banner" style={{width: '600px'}}/>

## Step 4: Technical Design & Architecture

### Code-Aware Planning
Unlike generic planning tools, Devplan understands your technical stack and generates implementation guidance that considers:

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Integration:**
- How new code fits into existing modules
- Database schema changes required
- API endpoints that need modification
- Dependencies and service interactions

**‚öôÔ∏è Technical Specifications:**
- Component structure and hierarchy
- State management requirements
- Testing strategy and coverage
- Performance considerations

## Step 5: User Stories & Task Breakdown

### Automated Story Generation
Devplan breaks down features into implementation-ready user stories with context-aware estimates based on your actual codebase complexity.

<img src={buildPlan} alt="Example banner" style={{width: '600px'}}/>

### Agentic Score
Devplan calculates Agentic Score (how likely AI IDE agent is to succeed with this user story) and size for each user 
story based on its complexity and ambiguity:

## Step 6: Integration with Project Management

### Seamless Sync to Your Tools

**Linear Integration Results:**

When Devplan syncs with Linear, it creates a complete project structure:
- **Epic Creation:** Main feature becomes a Linear epic with full context
- **Story Breakdown:** Individual user stories become properly formatted tickets
- **Time Estimates:** Each ticket includes time estimates and complexity ratings
- **Context Links:** Every ticket links back to original requirements and technical specs
- **Technical Details:** Implementation notes and file references included
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Detailed acceptance criteria for each story

**Jira Integration Results:**

For Jira workspaces, Devplan creates a structured hierarchy:
- **Epic Management:** Complex features become properly structured epics
- **Story Points:** Automatic story point assignment based on complexity
- **Sprint Assignment:** Stories assigned to sprints based on team capacity
- **Label Application:** Automatic tagging with relevant labels (frontend, backend, etc.)
- **Custom Fields:** Devplan data maps to your existing Jira custom fields
- **Workflow Integration:** Stories follow your established Jira workflows

:::tip Context Preservation
**Smart Linking:** Every ticket maintains a link back to:
- Original feature requirements
- Technical design decisions
- AI-generated implementation prompts
- Related tickets and dependencies

This ensures developers always have full context, even weeks later.
:::

## Step 7: AI Coding Prompts

### Context-Rich Prompt Generation
This is where Devplan's context engine really shines. Instead of generic prompts, you get:

**üéØ Specific Implementation Guidance:**
- Exact file paths and component names
- Integration points with existing code
- Code patterns and conventions to follow
- Error handling and edge case considerations

<img src={promptExample} alt="Prompt Example" style={{width: '600px'}}/>

## Step 8: CLI Integration

### Direct IDE Integration
Devplan's CLI tool integrates project management with local AI-powered IDEs. You can copy one-liner CLI commands
directly from the prompt popover and execute them in your terminal.
