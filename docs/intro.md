# Welcome to Devplan Documentation

Devplan is the AI-native product development platform that bridges the gap between product planning and engineering implementation. 
Unlike generic AI tools, Devplan maintains context throughout your entire development lifecycle—from initial idea to deployed code.

## Platform Overview

**🎯 The Problem We Solve**
Traditional development workflows lack guidance and lose context at every handoff, resulting in miscommunication, rework, 
and AI tools that generate code without understanding your specific needs and preferences.

**⚡ The Devplan Solution**
Context-driven workflows that preserve business intent, technical architecture, and implementation 
details from planning through coding.

**📊 Proven Results**
Teams see 8x faster planning, 25% better AI coding quality, and 80 minutes saved per feature.
