# Quickstart

Get from signup to your first feature in motion in under 10 minutes.

---

## 1. Create an account

Sign up at [devplan.com](https://devplan.com) using Google SSO or magic-link email. The 14-day free trial includes everything you need to run your first project.

---

## 2. Connect GitHub

Go to **Knowledge > Code Research > GitHub Connect**, authorize Devplan, and select the repositories you will be building in. First-time analysis takes around 30 minutes.

---

## 3. Create a project

Hit **New Project** and give the agent a short description — rough ideas, a ticket link, UX notes, or an uploaded doc all work. The agent will ask clarifying questions and turn it into a product brief and user stories.

---

## 4. Start a feature

Review your user stories, move to the **Development** tab for technical design, then sync to Linear or Jira. Grab the CLI command from any task to pull context into your AI IDE and start building.

For a full walkthrough of each step, see [Core Workflow](/core-workflow).
